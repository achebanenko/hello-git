This is *italic* and this is **bold**. Alo this is _italic_ and this is __bold__.

This is **_bold italic_**. This is ~~strike~~ text.


## 3. Headings

# H1
## H2
### H3
Headings have automatic id set
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
####### H7
Indeed H7 does not exist?

## 4. Links in Markdown

Wrap <http://link.com> inside <> to be a link, but it also works auto http://link.com

Link just with [text](//link.com) wrap in [] and just after put link in () 

You also can add title by adding quotes inside () here my [example.com](//example.com "Link to Example") of it

This course is brought you by [Wes][1] how is very cool teacher.  
Check [wes'][1] site - one more link with [][] here - it's recommended because then you would need to change link only in one place after end of the text

Or you use [text][word] as index, and then even only shortcut itself [word]
