Here is my code - but! **indentation** doesn't work for me:  
    var x = 100;
const dog = 'snickers';

Using code block instead with three \` before and after but as you can see, you can use `one backquote to highlight code inline`:

```php
$age = 50;
$name = "wes";
echo strtoupper($name);
```

And if you write `name` of the language (js, php, exc.) it also makes a coloring of your code.

You can use `diff` to show difference between lines of code

```diff
var x = 100;
- var y = 200;
+ var y = 300;
```
