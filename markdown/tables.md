Use **pipe around** columns and also separate table head from table body with `:` and any of `-`

| Dog's name | Dog's age |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| Snickers   | 2         |
| Prudence   | 8         |

And also you can align text in columns with `:` on left, right or on both sides for centering

|   Name   | Age |
| :------: | --: |
| Snickers |   2 |
| Prudence |   8 |
