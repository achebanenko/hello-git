Wrap <http://link.com> inside `<>` to be a link, but it also works auto http://link.com

Link just with [text](//link.com) wrap **text** in `[]` and just after put **link** in `()`

You also can add title by adding **quotes** inside `()` here my [example.com](//example.com 'Link to Example') of it

This course is brought you by [Wes][1] how is very cool teacher.  
Check [wes'][1] site - one more link with `[][]` here - it's recommended because then you would need to change link only in one place after end of the text

Or you use [text][word] as index, and then even only shortcut itself [word]
